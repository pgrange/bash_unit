# In this example, we want to test the specific functions of a script.
# So we source this script in setup_suite.
# However, we don't want the script to be executed when sourcing it,
# we are only interested in having access to the functions to test
# them.
# To do so, we adapt the script under test so that its main code
# is not executed when sourcing it.
# See in ../hello_i18n how we define a main function to encapsulate
# all the main code and the main function is only called when the
# script itself is launched, not when it is sourced.
